# 🛡️ MedGuard AI

MedGuard AI is a clinical decision-support prototype designed to assist clinicians
by monitoring patient vital signs, detecting early physiological deterioration,
and providing explainable risk insights.

## What does it do?
- Analyzes time-series vital signs (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, SpO₂, Temperature)
- Estimates patient risk level (Low / Early / High)
- Highlights contributing factors behind risk changes (Explainable AI)
- Presents trends and alerts in a clear, visual dashboard

## Important Note
MedGuard AI is an assistive system, not a diagnostic or prescriptive tool.
Final clinical decisions remain entirely with the healthcare professional.

## Technology
- Python
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Use Case
Early warning support for patient deterioration in clinical and ICU settings.
